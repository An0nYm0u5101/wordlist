The text files in this directory indicate possible problems with SCOWL
in regards to British English.  They are originally created by looking
for words that are in the Hunspell British dictionary created by SCOWL
that are not in the Hunspell dictionary originally created by David
Bartlett (http://en-gb.pyxidium.co.uk/dictionary/) and now maintained
by Marco A.G.Pinto
(http://marcoagpinto.cidadevirtual.pt/proofingtoolgui.html).

The scripts and source data to create these files can be found under
the src/ directory.  They were created from Git version 012ea06.

These files are meant to be modified by hand.  Once a potential issue
pointed out by the file is addressed the entry can just be deleted.
Additional notes may also be added in the forms of comments until the
issue is resolved.  Each file is associated GitHub issue where
discussion on how tro address the issues pointed out by these files.

The files are:

varcon-lookinto.txt:

Entries in VarCon that could possible be corrected. [Issue #64]

varcon-notin.txt:

Other variants not in VarCon that could possible to added. [Issue #65]

varcon-compound.txt:

Compound words that are in David/Marco's list but with a dash. [Issue #67]

abbreviation.txt:

Abbreviations either not in David/Marco's list, or in that list but
marked with a trailing '.'. [Issue #70]

2of12id-lookinto.txt:

Entries in 2of12id that need a closer look. [Issue #71]

possessive.txt:

Possessive forms not in David/Marco's dictionary.  

Words marked with a '-' were likely removed by David Bartlett for one
reason or another; words starting with a '+' are new words that were
likely added since David Bartlett fork. [1]

[Issue #68]

40.txt 50.txt 60.txt:

Other words not in David/Marco's that can not be classified by any of
the above lists.  Some of words are clearly mistakes (at least
according to this American) on David's parts, other of them were
likely removed because there were considered an Americanism.

The number correspond to SCOWL sizes.

Like in possessive.txt, words marked with a '-' were likely removed
by David Bartlett for one reason or another; words starting with a '+'
are new words that were likely added since David Bartlett fork. [1]

[Issue #72]


[1] The exact Hunspell dictionary version David Bartlett orignally
used is unknown so a best-guess was made.
