SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) is a database of English
words that can be used to create word lists suitable for use in spell
checkers of various sizes and dialects (America, British (both -ise
and -ize) and Canadian).  However, I am sure it will have numerous
other uses as well.

The main product of SCOWL are [spell checker dictionaries](dicts) for
Hunspell and Aspell.

SCOWL was created by carefully combing many other high quality
wordlists.  The creation of SCOWL also lead to many other useful
artifacts.

One of the main sources used by SCOWL is Alan Beale [12Dicts](12dicts)
package.

One of the main artifacts created was the [VarCon](varcon) (Variant
Conversion) database, that can be used to convert between American,
British and Canadian dictionaries.
