<i>January 28, 2015</i><br>

A new version is now available.  There were no changes in AGID so that
component was not updated.

<p>

A <a href="http://app.aspell.net/lookup-freq">new tool</a> is now
available to aid in determining if a given word should be added to
SCOWL (at levels 60 and 70) and hence appear in the speller
dictionaries.  It looks up words in the Google Book's Corpus
(1980-2008) and assigns a score that indicates if a word should or
should not be considered for inclusion based on its frequency in
corpus.  The tool will also look for similar more common words to help
determine if adding the less common word might cause a problem.  (Less
common words that are very similar to more common words are less
likely to be accepted in a speller dictionary as they can easily mask
an incorrect spelling of the more common word.)
