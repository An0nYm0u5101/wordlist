This directory contains scripts for converting SCOWL into a simple
SQLite database for easier querying.

To create the database run the create.sh script from scowl/ directory.
It will create the file "scowl.db".

The perl utility speller_lookup uses this database to check if a word
is in one of the speller dictionaries.
