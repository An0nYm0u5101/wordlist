Variant Conversion Info (VARCON)
Revision 5.1 (SVN Revision 161)
January 6, 2011
by Kevin Atkinson (kevina@gnu.org)

This package contains information to convert between American,
British, and Canadian spellings and vocabulary as well and other
variant information.

CHANGES:

From Revision 5.0 to Revision 5.1 (January 6, 2010)

  - Corrected numerous errors after running various forms
    of verification on varcon.txt.

  - Reordered the clusters in varcon.txt so that they are
    mostly in alphabetic order based on the headword.

From Revision 4.1 to Revision 5.0 (December 27, 2010)

  - Completely new format for the main table which, in addition to
    providing the preferred spelling of a word for various forms of
    English, also records variant and other information.  To reflect
    this change, the name of the file was renamed from abbc.tab to
    varcon.txt.

  - Massive effort to verify the variant information against
    authoritative sources (mainly Oxford dictionaries).  Most entries
    for common words (SCOWL level 35 and below) have been checked
    against at least a British and Canadian dictionary.

  - Added variant information for numerous other words, even when
    there is no difference between the various forms on English.

  - Other changes corresponding to the new format.
